# Tutorial: How to install and use the SC_CORE Sprite.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the SC_CORE sprite and make your projects Scratch Coins compatible.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. A ```Scratch account``` (create one at https://scratch.mit.edu).
2. A ```Scratch Coins account``` (create one at https://scratch-coins-website.herasium.repl.co/register)
3. The ```Scratcher``` role on scratch permitting the user of Cloud Variables.

## Rules

You are not allowed to modify the ```SC_CORE``` Sprite in any way, including code and costumes, as well as modifying the variables with the ```[SC_CORE]``` prefix outside the ```SC_CORE``` sprite.

And disregard of these rules will result in deletion of the Scratch Coins project.

## In Scratch

First, go to this [Scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/883112383/editor) and backpack the 2 sprites inside, ```[SC_CORE]``` and ```[SC_INTERFACE]```.

After that, go to the project that you want to make Scratch Coins compatible and place the 2 inside.

You can now modify the ```[SC_INTERFACE]``` sprite and use the 6 functions inside to adapt your project.

The ```[SC_INTEFACE]``` sprite is not necessary and can be removed; its only purpose is to serve as an example on how to use the ```[SC_CORE]``` sprite.

## On Scratch Coins

When you have finished making your project, you can go to the [add a project page](https://scratch-coins-website.herasium.repl.co/add) and paste your project ID and give it a simple name.

Remember that your project has to be shared for the ```[SC_CORE]``` sprite to work.

## Limitations

There are two main limitations.

1. There is a cooldown of 1 minute for the project and 1 minute for the user between each utilisation of the ```Reward``` function.

2. You can only make the user buy an item with an integer cost, example:

    1, 2, and 3 are integers, but 1.1, 1.02, and 1.5 are floats and are not valid. The minimum purchase cost is 1 wich means that you can't create free items using the  ```[SC_CORE]``` sprite.
